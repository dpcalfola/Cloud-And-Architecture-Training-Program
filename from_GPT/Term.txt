1. STAR 기법

    The STAR solution is a framework used in problem-solving and behavioral interviews to structure your response and provide a comprehensive answer. The acronym STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Here's a breakdown of each component:

    1. Situation: Begin by setting the context and describing the specific situation or problem you encountered. Explain the background, the challenges or issues you faced, and any relevant details necessary to understand the situation.

    2. Task: Clearly define the task or objective you were assigned or the goal you needed to achieve within the given situation. Describe what was expected of you and what you aimed to accomplish.

    3. Action: Outline the actions you took to address the situation or solve the problem. Describe the specific steps you implemented, the decisions you made, and the strategies you employed. Focus on your individual contributions and highlight any skills or competencies you utilized.

    4. Result: Explain the outcome of your actions. Share the specific results or achievements you accomplished, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Discuss the impact of your actions on the situation, project, team, or organization. If possible, quantify the results or provide specific examples to demonstrate the success of your solution.

    By using the STAR solution framework, you provide a structured and concise response that showcases your problem-solving abilities, highlights your actions and decision-making process, and demonstrates the positive results you achieved. This format helps interviewers assess your skills, experience, and suitability for the role by evaluating your ability to handle challenges and deliver effective solutions.




2. IDC ?

    International Data Corporation: International Data Corporation is a global market intelligence and advisory firm specializing in providing insights and analysis on technology markets. IDC offers research, consulting services, and events to assist businesses, governments, and IT professionals in making informed decisions and understanding industry trends.



3. On-premises ?

    On-premises (or on-premise) refers to a computing or software deployment model in which an organization hosts and manages its own infrastructure and applications within its physical premises or data centers. In an on-premises environment, the organization owns and operates the hardware, software, and networking resources required for running its applications and storing its data.

    Key characteristics of an on-premises deployment include:

    1. Local infrastructure: The organization maintains and manages its own servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and other hardware resources within its own facilities.

    2. Control and customization: With an on-premises deployment, organizations have full control over the hardware, software, configurations, and security measures implemented within their environment. This enables greater customization and tailoring of the infrastructure to specific needs.

    3. Data sovereignty: Since the data and applications are hosted within the organization's premises, there is a higher degree of control and data sovereignty, as the organization retains ownership and physical control over its data.

    4. Responsibility for maintenance: The organization is responsible for tasks such as hardware provisioning, software updates, security patches, backups, and overall infrastructure maintenance.

    5. Initial investment: On-premises deployments typically involve upfront capital expenditure for purchasing hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure setup.

    On-premises deployments are often favored by organizations that have stringent security and compliance requirements, need greater control over their data and infrastructure, or have specific performance or integration needs. However, on-premises solutions require significant upfront investment, ongoing maintenance, and may have limitations in terms of scalability and flexibility compared to cloud-based alternatives.

    It's worth noting that on-premises deployments can coexist with hybrid or multi-cloud strategies, where organizations utilize a combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud services to meet their specific needs.




4. Gateway

     a device or a computer system that serves as an entry point or exit point between two different networks. It acts as a bridge, facilitating communication and data transfer between networks that use different protocols, addressing schemes, or technologies.







5. ARP

    ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a communication protocol used in computer networks to map an IP address to a physical or MAC address. In an Ethernet network, each device has a unique MAC address assigned to its network interface card (NIC). However, when devices communicate with each other over IP, they use IP addresses instead of MAC addresses.

    ARP allows a device to discover the MAC address associated with a given IP address within the local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device, it checks its ARP cache to see if it already has the MAC address of the destination IP address. If the MAC address is not in the cache, the device sends an ARP request packet to the network asking for the MAC address associated with the IP address. The device with the corresponding IP address responds with an ARP reply packet containing its MAC address, allowing the requesting device to update its ARP cache and establish communication with the destination device.

    ARP is a critical component of the TCP/IP protocol suite and is used extensively in local area networks (LANs) and other IP-based networks to facilitate communication between devices.






6.

    MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit. It is a parameter that defines the maximum size of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network link in a single frame or packet without fragmentation. In other words, it represents the largest amount of data that can be sent in one transmission without being divided into smaller units.

    The MTU size is usually measured in bytes and varies depending on the network technology and the underlying data link layer protocol. Different network technologies and protocols have different MTU limits, and it's important to configure the MTU appropriately to avoid issues with data transmission and network performance.

    When a device sends a packet that exceeds the MTU size of a network link, fragmentation may occur. Fragmentation is the process of breaking the packet into smaller units, or fragments, that fit within the MTU limit of the network link. The fragments are reassembled at the receiving end to reconstruct the original packet. However, fragmentation can introduce overhead, additional processing, and potential delays in data transmission.

    It's worth noting that the MTU value can vary in different network layers. For example, in the context of TCP/IP networking, the MTU can refer to the maximum size of the payload within an IP packet, excluding the IP and transport layer headers. Additionally, the Path MTU (PMTU) refers to the smallest MTU value along the entire path between the source and destination, considering the network devices and links traversed.

    Configuring the correct MTU value is crucial for efficient and reliable network communication. It requires consideration of factors such as the network technology, protocol overhead, potential fragmentation, and the capabilities of the devices and links involved in the communication.
